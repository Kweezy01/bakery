- 📫 How to reach me kweezystreams@gmail.com, @KewanSeymour on twitter


I created this silly react project for myself and my brother so that we could
sell baked goods to nearby customers who would find out about the website through
strategically placed QR codes.

If you would like to help please dont hesitate to email me or send a request.

Thanks;
